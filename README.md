# Polemic

Polemic is a tool for publishing online academic content, such as blogs, articles and tutorials.
Polemic is built on top of [Unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and is shipped as a simple to use CLI.
It's inspired by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

Polemic documents are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) which is a plain-text markup language.
It offers support for math (through KaTeX), footnotes, images, videos and more.

Polemic documents are transformed into beautiful, responsive websites that can be deployed anywhere.
