# Polemic Parchment

Parchment is a Next.js project that is used to render Polemic documents locally.
It's actually not much more than a Next.js app that implements @polemic/react,
@polemic/parser and @polemic/binder. 

## Usage
This package does not export anything and is only used for serving as a template
for new Polemic projects.
